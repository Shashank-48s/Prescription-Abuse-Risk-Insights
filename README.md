# 💊 Prescription Drug Abuse Detection System

A data analytics project focused on identifying and monitoring potential prescription drug misuse using patient records and medication patterns. The goal is to improve awareness, support healthcare safety, and provide insights that could help reduce prescription drug abuse.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project uses a healthcare dataset containing patient details, prescriptions, dosage levels, refill counts, and medical conditions. It analyzes patterns to detect unusual refill behaviors, high-risk drug classes, and misuse indicators using visual reports.

The final output is a **Power BI dashboard** that helps healthcare professionals and stakeholders track drug usage trends and act on risky prescription behavior.
